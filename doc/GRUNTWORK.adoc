= The GruntWurk Mission

The GruntWurk mission is to support open-source Python projects by making it easy for potential new contributors to jump on board.
As the name implies, we aim to take the grunt-work out of project development, hiding away the complexities so that contributors can immediately get down to business.
The shorter the learning curve, the easier it is for contributors to join in.

== Values

. Simplicity
. Respect
. Communication
. Feedback
. Reliability

The first four are straight out of "`eXtreme Programming Explained`" (Kent Beck, 1999).
XP is the "`OG`" of agile software development.
When Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, and the rest fail (which they do frequently and spectacularly), it's because they stray from these core values.


== Strategies and Tactics

. Our #1 strategy towards fulfilling this mission is to start with *tried-and-true Python facilities* (`ArgParser`, `ConfigParser`, built-in `Logging`, etc.) -- because they are familiar to most Python programmers -- and then work to simplify their usage.
But, again, nothing is forced.
You can pick and choose alternatives for any or all of these facilities.

. For boilerplate code, *we prefer libraries* of classes and functions *over collections of code snippets/templates*.
Snippets are great and we use them too, but code that is centralized is easier to maintain, easier to test, and easier to document.

. We know it's important that this library *exemplifies clean, Pythonic, easily understandable code.*

** We follow the usual Python practices (such as using opinionated linters and formatters).
** We maintain the API docs to be as thorough and accurate as possible (erring on the side of verbosity).
** We actively remove (or deprecate) dead code, so as not to be confusing.
** We use `TODO` and `FIXME` comments generously.
** (TODO what else?)

== Continuity and Reliability of these Projects

Regarding our value of *Reliability,* we've seen too many worthy projects on GitHub abandoned by their originators (for whatever reason).
The "GruntWurk" organization was created on github specifically with continuity of business in mind.
Anyone interested in becoming an alternate custodian of these GruntWurk projects is welcome to apply.
We aim to ensure that these projects are well-supported and trustworthy, with someone responsible always at the helm.
